FRED Announcement Sentiment Analysis and Its Impact on the S&P 500
Developed a comprehensive analysis project that examines the effects of FRED announcements on the S&P 500 index based on the sentiment derived from those announcements. The goal is to analyze how sentiment influences stock price movements and to explore different momentum strategies in relation to both sentiment and S&P 500 performance, while also incorporating other relevant economic data from FRED and financial instruments.
